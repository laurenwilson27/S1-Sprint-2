# Semester 1 Final Sprint - Project 3

## Lauren Wilson, August 2023

### Description

The JavaScript portion of my previous QAP had a relatively bland theme (Canadian provinces), so I went with something a bit more esoteric this time: a few different types of dragons in D&D. This project contains a JSON file decribing a limited selection of dragons from that game, as well as JavaScript used by an HTML page to parse the JSON file and report some of the information contained within it.

### Usage

Simply download this repository and then open _index.html_ in a web browser.
